# Phase 2: Core Actions Development

## Phase Title
Core Actions Development & Agent Implementation

## Objectives
1. Develop essential GitHub Actions for common CI/CD tasks
2. Implement SPARC methodology across all actions
3. Integrate specialized agents for each action type
4. Create comprehensive test suites for all actions
5. Establish action versioning and release processes

## Key Deliverables
1. **Code Quality Actions**
   - Linting action with multi-language support
   - Code formatting action
   - Complexity analysis action
   - Type checking action

2. **Testing Actions**
   - Unit test runner action
   - Integration test action
   - E2E test orchestrator
   - Coverage reporter action

3. **Security Actions**
   - Dependency vulnerability scanner
   - Secret detection action
   - SAST (Static Application Security Testing) action
   - License compliance checker

4. **Documentation Actions**
   - API documentation generator
   - README updater
   - Changelog generator
   - Documentation validator

## Tasks / Workstreams

### Workstream 1: Code Quality Actions

- [ ] Develop CodeQL analysis action
- [ ] Implement OWASP dependency check
- [ ] Create license compliance validator

### Workstream 4: Agent Integration
- [ ] Configure code-analyzer agent for quality checks
- [ ] Set up tester agent for test orchestration
- [ ] Implement security-manager agent
- [ ] Deploy reviewer agent for automated reviews
- [ ] Configure performance-benchmarker agent

### Workstream 5: SPARC Implementation
- [ ] Apply Specification phase to each action
- [ ] Create Pseudocode for complex workflows
- [ ] Design Architecture for action composition
- [ ] Implement Refinement with TDD
- [ ] Complete integration testing

## Dependencies
- Phase 1 completion (infrastructure ready)
- Access to language-specific tools and packages
- GitHub API tokens for enhanced features
- Third-party service integrations (SonarQube, Snyk)
- Agent training data from Phase 1

## Risks & Mitigation Strategies

### Risk 1: Tool Compatibility Issues
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Probability**: High
- **Mitigation**:
  - Test across multiple language versions
  - Provide compatibility matrices
  - Implement graceful fallbacks
  - Version-specific configurations

### Risk 2: Performance Degradation
- **Impact**: High
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement aggressive caching
  - Parallel execution where possible
  - Optimize Docker images
  - Monitor action execution times

### Risk 3: False Positive Security Alerts
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Probability**: High
- **Mitigation**:
  - Tune security tool configurations
  - Implement allowlisting mechanisms
  - Provide clear remediation guidance
  - Regular rule updates

### Risk 4: Agent Coordination Complexity
- **Impact**: High
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Mitigation**:
  - Start with simple agent tasks
  - Implement robust error handling
  - Create agent communication protocols
  - Build monitoring dashboards

## Success Criteria
- [ ] 15+ production-ready actions deployed
- [ ] All actions pass integration tests
- [ ] 90% code coverage across all actions
- [ ] Average execution time < 2 minutes per action
- [ ] Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Documentation complete for all actions
- [ ] Agent success rate > 95%

## Estimated Duration
**5-6 weeks**

### Week 1-2: Code Quality Actions Development
### Week 2-3: Testing Actions Suite
### Week 3-4: Security Actions Implementation
### Week 4-5: Agent Integration and Training
### Week 5-6: SPARC Refinement and Testing

## Team Requirements
- 2 Senior Software Engineers
- 2 Software Engineers
- 1 Security Engineer
- 1 QA Lead
- 1 DevOps Engineer
- 1 Technical Writer

## Budget Considerations
- Third-party tool licenses (SonarQube, Snyk)
- Increased GitHub Actions minutes usage
- Agent training compute resources
- Additional storage for artifacts
- Security tool subscriptions

## Performance Benchmarks
- Linting action: < 30 seconds
- Test runner: < 2 minutes for medium repos
- Security scan: < 90 seconds
- Documentation generation: < 60 seconds
- Agent coordination overhead: < 10%

## Integration Points
- GitHub Checks API for status reporting
- GitHub Pull Request API for comments
- GitHub Releases API for versioning
- npm registry for package dependencies
- Docker Hub for container images

## Next Phase Trigger
Phase 2 completion criteria:
- All core actions deployed and tested
- Agent integration stable
- Performance benchmarks met
- Security review completed
- User acceptance testing passed
- Migration guide prepared
