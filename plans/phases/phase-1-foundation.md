# Phase 1: Foundation & Infrastructure Setup

## Phase Title
Foundation & Infrastructure Setup

## Objectives
1. Establish core infrastructure for shared GitHub Actions
2. Set up Claude-Flow integration and MCP server configuration
3. Create base action templates and directory structure
4. Implement initial CI/CD pipeline for the actions repository
5. Establish testing and validation frameworks

## Key Deliverables
1. **Repository Structure**
   - Organized action directories
   - Template files for new actions
   - Configuration management setup
   
2. **Core Infrastructure**
   - MCP server deployment
   - Claude-Flow integration
   - Base GitHub Actions workflows
   
3. **Development Environment**
   - Local testing setup
   - Debugging tools
   - Documentation templates
   
4. **Initial Actions**
   - Hello World action (proof of concept)
   - Basic linting action
   - Simple test runner action

## Tasks / Workstreams

### Workstream 1: Repository Setup
- [ ] Create GitHub repository structure
- [ ] Set up branch protection rules
- [ ] Configure repository settings and permissions
- [ ] Initialize npm/package.json for Claude-Flow
- [ ] Set up .github/workflows directory

### Workstream 2: Claude-Flow Integration
- [ ] Install and configure Claude-Flow MCP server
- [ ] Set up claude-flow.config.json
- [ ] Configure .mcp.json for server settings
- [ ] Test agent spawning capabilities
- [ ] Verify memory persistence

### Workstream 3: Action Templates
- [ ] Create composite action template
- [ ] Create JavaScript action template
- [ ] Create Docker action template
- [ ] Develop action.yml schema templates
- [ ] Build input/output validation patterns

### Workstream 4: Testing Framework
- [ ] Set up Jest for JavaScript testing
- [ ] Create action testing utilities
- [ ] Implement mock GitHub context
- [ ] Build integration test harness
- [ ] Configure code coverage tools

### Workstream 5: CI/CD Pipeline
- [ ] Create main workflow for PR validation
- [ ] Implement automated testing workflow
- [ ] Set up release workflow
- [ ] Configure dependency updates
- [ ] Add security scanning

## Dependencies
- GitHub repository access and permissions
- Node.js 18+ environment
- npm registry access
- Claude-Flow alpha package availability
- Development team onboarding

## Risks & Mitigation Strategies

### Risk 1: Claude-Flow Integration Complexity
- **Impact**: High
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Start with simple agent configurations
  - Gradual feature adoption
  - Maintain fallback to standard workflows
  - Comprehensive documentation

### Risk 2: Team Adoption Challenges
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Probability**: High
- **Mitigation**:
  - Provide training sessions
  - Create video tutorials
  - Build interactive examples
  - Establish support channels

### Risk 3: Performance Issues
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Probability**: Low
- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement performance benchmarks early
  - Monitor resource usage
  - Optimize agent configurations
  - Use caching strategies

### Risk 4: Security Vulnerabilities
- **Impact**: High
- **Probability**: Low
- **Mitigation**:
  - Regular security audits
  - Automated vulnerability scanning
  - Principle of least privilege
  - Secret management best practices

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Repository structure established and documented
- [ ] Claude-Flow successfully integrated and tested
- [ ] At least 3 working prototype actions
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline running successfully
- [ ] Testing framework achieving 80% code coverage
- [ ] Documentation complete for all components

## Estimated Duration
**3-4 weeks**

### Week 1: Repository and Infrastructure Setup
### Week 2: Claude-Flow Integration and Configuration
### Week 3: Action Templates and Testing Framework
### Week 4: CI/CD Pipeline and Documentation

## Team Requirements
- 1 DevOps Engineer (lead)
